similar to the previous level, we call printf dirctly on the user input, but here we compare the global variable to a big value
and if the check passes then the program try to cat the flag using system call

again we try to find where is the vraible located in printf args and we set it to this big value using %n and using printf flag modifiers (%16930112d will print 16930112 character)

~$ ./level4 <<< $(python -c "print '\x10\x98\x04\x08%4\$16930112d'+'%12\$n'")
