in this level, the program allocate 64 bytes for a string then allocate 4 bytes to hold the address of a function that prints a message
in the first allocation we use strcpy to copy the content of the first arg of the program
strcpy does not handle overflow so we can give a string that will erase the value of the second allocation so that it points to the function n that opens the shell and cat the flag

(gdb) x n
0x8048454 <n>:	0x83e58955

the second allocation is located 72 bytes after the first one, so we can give 72 random bytes then give the address of n
